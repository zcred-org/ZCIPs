# ZCred Improvement Proposals (ZCIPs)

ZCred protocol is necessary to provide the subject with the ability to confirm their attributes in the digital space without disclosing the attributes themselves. This allows the subject to avoid leaving a digital trace of their identity in the digital space and gives them complete control over their representation in the digital world.

The goal of the ZCred Improvement Proposals (ZCIPs) is to create standards and document improvements to ZCred protocol and it's ecosystem.
